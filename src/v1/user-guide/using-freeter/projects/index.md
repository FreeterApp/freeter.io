# Projects

Projects are base units in Freeter. They represent projects you are working on, be it a website you are designing, a mobile application you are developing, a set of articles you are writing, etc.

Each time you start working on a project, add it to Freeter first. That should become a part of your workflow in order to improve your productivity in a long run.

## Adding, Updating, Deleting Projects

Use the Manage Projects menu to add / delete projects and edit their settings.

## Project Directory

Use the project directory setting to specify the root directory where the project files are stored. This setting is used by different Freeter components. For example, you can execute command lines in the project directory or copy files to/from the project directory with a single click.
