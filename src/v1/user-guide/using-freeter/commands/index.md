# Commands

Commands enable you to execute command lines in a project directory and copy files to/from a project directory with a single mouse click. Example scenarios when the commands will save your time:

- You have project templates, and you use them as a base for new projects by copying them to project directories.
- You always need to execute same command lines. For example, install dependencies by 'npm install' and 'bower install', build applications by 'gulp build', and so on.

Both the scenarios can be turned into Freeter commands executable by a simple mouse click.
