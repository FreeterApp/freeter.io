# Back up & Sync data

## Backing up data automatically

If you want to keep your Freeter data safe, you may back it up to your cloud storage.

1. Launch Freeter.
2. Open Settings menu. On Windows: File > Settings; On Mac OS: Freeter > Preferences; On Linux: File > Preferences;
3. Find the Back up & sync settings, and click on "Set Backup / Sync Folder".
4. Choose a location within a folder synced to a cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive,
OneDrive, etc.).
5. Done! Freeter will create a data storage there, and will auto-update it with changes you make.
6. If you changed the computer, or the operating system and want to restore the Freeter data, then open Settings menu, click on "Set Backup / Sync Folder" and select a folder with the Freeter data storage file (Freeter.freeterdata) created on your previous computer / operating system. Freeter will load the data from it and will continue updating it with new changes you make. Please keep in mind that Freeter doesn't backup the file/folder paths as they are specific to each computer and operating system.

## Backing up data manually

Also you can back up data manually, if you don't want Freeter to update the backup data storage each time you made changes.

1. Launch Freeter.
2. Open Settings menu. On Windows: File > Settings; On Mac OS: Freeter > Preferences; On Linux: File > Preferences;
3. Find the Back up & sync settings, and click on "Set Backup / Sync Folder".
4. Choose a location within a folder synced to a cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive,
OneDrive, etc.).
5. Freeter will create a data storage there.
6. Enable the "Back up & sync manually" option to disable the auto-backups.
7. Now when you want to update the backup data storage with the data from your Freeter instance, push the Backup button in the "Backup operations" section below.

## Syncing data

If you have more than one computer, you may sync the Freeter data so that both computers have access to the same projects, tabs, dashboards, etc.

1. First launch Freeter on the computer that contains the data you want to copy to the second computer.
2. Open Settings menu. On Windows: File > Settings; On Mac OS: Freeter > Preferences; On Linux: File > Preferences;
3. Find the Back up & sync settings, and click on "Set Backup / Sync Folder".
4. Choose a location where you want to sync your data. The location should be within a folder synced to a cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive,
OneDrive, etc.). Freeter will create a sync data storage there.
5. Allow the cloud app (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive) to sync fully before starting setup on your second computer.
6. Then launch Freeter on the second computer.
7. Open Settings menu.
8. Click on "Set Backup / Sync Folder".
9. Select a folder with the Freeter data storage file (Freeter.freeterdata) from your first computer.
10. Freeter will load the data from the data storage file and notifies you about that.
11. Now complete the setup on your second machine by entering file/folder paths in projects', tabs', widgets' settings. Freeter doesn't sync the file/folder paths between computers as they are specific to each computer and operating system.
