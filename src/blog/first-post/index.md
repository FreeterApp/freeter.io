h1: How to Boost Your Productivity While Managing Multiple Projects
intro: |-
  If you’re a **freelance developer**, **app creator**, or **open-source maintainer**, you know how challenging it can be to stay productive while working on **multiple projects**.

  Between switching code editors, design mockups, project dashboards, emails, and docs, you spend more time **managing tools** than actually getting work done.

  If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. The good news? There’s a better way to **organize your workflows** and **boost your productivity** — with **Freeter**, a free and **open-source productivity app** designed to help you **manage multiple projects in one place**.

## The Problem: Too Many Tools, Too Many Tabs

Working on several projects means constantly switching contexts:

- Opening your code editor and locating the right project files
- Jumping into your task manager to track progress
- Searching for icons, design assets, and documentation
- Checking Gmail and Twitter DMs across multiple accounts
- Running terminal commands for builds and deployments

When everything is scattered, **productivity drops**. You waste time switching between tools instead of focusing on your actual work.

## The Solution: Organize Everything in One App

That’s where **Freeter** comes in. It’s a **free, open-source productivity tool** that lets you:

- Collect everything you need for each project in one place
- Create **custom workflows** for development, messaging, releases, and more
- Switch between projects instantly — without losing context
- Reduce tab clutter and repetitive clicks

Let’s break it down with three real examples of **Freeter workflows** that can **save you hours every week**.

Freeter helps you create a **developer-friendly workspace** where everything you need is just one click away:
