  If you’ve ever wished there was an easier way to **manage multiple email accounts in one place**, you’re not alone — and we’ve got great news.

## Why Use Freeter to Manage Multiple Email Accounts?

Freeter isn’t just another email client. It’s a **workspace organizer** that lets you bring **all your web apps** — including Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, ProtonMail, and more — together into **one clean, organized interface**.

- **Add unlimited email accounts** — even multiple instances of the same provider
- Run Gmail and other most used web apps like a **native desktop app**
- Switch between personal and work emails instantly
- Organize everything into **projects and workflows** for maximum efficiency
- 100% **free** and **open-source** — no sign-ups, no hidden fees

With Freeter, managing multiple inboxes finally becomes effortless.

## All Your Email Apps in One Place

One of Freeter’s superpowers is its ability to handle **as many email accounts as you need** — even from the same provider.

Say you have:

- Two Gmail accounts (personal + work)
- One Outlook inbox
- One ProtonMail account

Instead of juggling four different browser tabs, you can keep **all your email accounts in a single workflow tab** inside Freeter.

Even better, Freeter runs Gmail (and other web apps) like a **desktop app** — perfect since Gmail doesn’t have an official desktop client. Open your inbox directly from Freeter and stay focused without tab overload.

## Stay Organized with Projects & Workflows

Freeter makes it easy to **organize your email accounts** the way you work.

- **Projects** help you group related workflows — for example, “Personal,” “Work,” or “Project A”, “Project B”, “Project C”, or “Client A”, “Client B”, “Client C”.
- **Workflows** let you separate accounts or providers inside each project.

Example setup:

- **Project 1: Personal** → 3 Gmail accounts + 1 Outlook
- **Project 2: Work** → 2 Gmail accounts + 4 Outlook + 1 ProtonMail

Switching between contexts is instant, and your inboxes stay neatly organized — no more mixing personal and professional emails.

## Sessions: No More Repeated Logins

Tired of logging in every time you switch email accounts? Freeter’s **Sessions** feature solves that.

Each web app instance can keep its own **separate login session**, so you stay signed in to multiple Gmail, Outlook, or iCloud accounts at once.

You control how sessions are stored using **Session Scopes**:

- **Widget** → Keep the account only for this app instance.
- **Workflow** → Share the same session within one workflow.
- **Project** → Share the session across all workflows within one project.
- **Application** → Share the session everywhere in Freeter.

Plus, with **Session Persistence**, you choose whether to stay signed in after closing Freeter — or automatically clear your sessions for privacy.
