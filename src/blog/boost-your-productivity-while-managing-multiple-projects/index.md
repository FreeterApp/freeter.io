h1: How to Boost Your Productivity While Managing Multiple Projects
intro: |-
  If you’re a **freelancer**, a **web developer**, an **open-source maintainer**, or someone working on **multiple projects**, you know how challenging it can be to stay productive. Your brain wants to focus, but your tools keep dragging you everywhere.

  You jump between code editors, mockup files, project dashboards, task managers, terminals, docs, emails, Twitter DMs… and after a while, it feels like **you’re working more on switching tasks than on actually doing them**.

  If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. The good news? There’s a better way to **organize your workflows** and **boost your productivity** — with **Freeter**, a free and **open-source productivity app** designed to help you **manage multiple projects in one place**.

## The Problem: Too Many Tools, Too Many Tabs

Working on multiple projects often means endless **context switching**:

- Opening your code editor and digging for the right project files.
- Jumping into a client’s task manager to check tasks and deadlines.
- Searching across different websites for icons, design assets, or documentation.
- Logging into Gmail and Twitter DMs across several accounts.
- Running project-specific terminal commands for builds and deployments.

When everything is scattered, **productivity drops**. You waste time switching between tools instead of focusing on your actual work.

## The Solution: Organize Everything in One App

That’s where **Freeter** comes in. It’s a **free, open-source productivity tool** that lets you:

- Collect everything you need for each project in one place.
- Create **custom workflows** for development, messaging, releases, and more.
- Switch between projects instantly — without losing your flow.
- Reduce tab clutter and repetitive clicks.

Let’s break it down with three real examples of **Freeter workflows** that can **save you hours every week**.

## Workflow #1: App / Website Development

Imagine this: you open one workflow screen, and **everything you need** to start coding is right there:

- A task manager, embedded directly into the screen.
- One-click openers for your project files and mockups.
- Built-in search for MDN, Node.js docs, and your favorite icon websites.
- A notes widget for quick ideas.
- One-click links to your repo, bug reports, and feature requests.

You don’t waste time jumping around. You just **switch into “dev mode”** instantly.

## Workflow #2: Email & Twitter DMs

If you manage **multiple accounts**, you know the pain of logging in and out just to check messages.

With Freeter, you can:

- Embed Gmail and Twitter DMs directly into one workflow.
- Use **project-specific sessions**, so each workflow stays logged into the right account automatically.

No more hassle of switching accounts or browsers — just open your Messages workflow, and you’re ready to reply.

## Workflow #3: New App Release

Releasing a new version used to mean juggling multiple tools. Now, you can handle it in one place:

- **Release** → Execute build scripts directly from Freeter.
- **Open Releases** → Jump straight to the releases page in your browser.
- **Planned Features** → Update the Freeter community post with ease.
- **Tasks** → Review completed work without leaving your workflow.
- **Release Steps** → Follow a checklist so nothing gets overlooked.
