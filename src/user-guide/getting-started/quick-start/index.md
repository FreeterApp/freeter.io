# Quick Start

To get a quick start, let's add a first project to Freeter and upgrade the repetitive actions mentioned in [What is it for?](../what-is-it-for.html).

## Adding Project

1. Go to Project Manager by clicking the Manage Projects button.
2. Push the Add Project button.
3. Select a directory for your project.
4. Click the Done button.

Done! You've just added a first project.

## Adding Opener

The first example mentioned in [What is it for?](../what-is-it-for.html) was about Opening Project Files with Editing Tool. To open multiple files with a single click we will use Opener widget.

1. Turn on the layout edit mode by clicking the Edit Layout button.
2. Drag & Drop Opener widget from the header bar.
3. Open the Widget Configuration menu by pushing the Configure Widget button at the top right corner of the dropped widget (or via the contextual "right-click" menu).
4. Select "Open File(s)" on the Type list.
5. Specify all files you want to open with your editing tool in the area below.
6. Click the Finish Editing button.

Done. You've just added a first action enabling you to open your project files with a single click. Now let's see how it's easy to open the project files from wherever you want. Switch from Freeter to any other application, for example, open Web Browser. Press <span class="hotkey"><span>Ctrl (or Cmd)</span>+<span>Shift</span>+<span>F</span></span> to quickly bring up Freeter, and click the opener. It is quicker and easier than locating and opening files manually, isn't it?

## Adding Webpage

The second example was about Checking Tasks on Task Manager. For embedding Task Manager into the project dashboard we will use Webpage widget.

1. Turn on the layout edit mode again.
2. Drag & Drop Webpage widget from the header bar.
3. Open the Widget Configuration menu.
4. Enter an address of a task manager page where the project tasks are published.
5. Click the Finish Editing button. You should see the task manager on the project dashboard.

Done. Let's try it. Switch from Freeter to any other application. Press <span class="hotkey"><span>Ctrl (or Cmd)</span>+<span>Shift</span>+<span>F</span></span>. The Task Manager is in front of your eyes. It is quicker and easier than opening the task manager via Web Browser manually, isn't it?


Now you have an idea of what Freeter does. In the next chapter you will dive deeper into its features.
